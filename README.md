# Warp.css

After reading the name of the project you probably saying that
"Oh! Come on! Here comes another CSS library!"
Yes, It is! But, I did not create this CSS library to compete with Bootstrap, Semantic UI or Materialize.css

## Why I did this project?
I created this library for 2 reasons:
1. To have practical experience on how to publish an npm library.
2. To build a system so that I can apply the same styles across all of my projects.

## Technologies Implemented:
1. CSS3
2. Sass

## Usage:
I know it sounds awkward, but I have not created any documentation for this library.
Since this library does not contain any unique features that other developers can be benefitted from, I do not have any plan to create one.
But, I have added comments on top of every CSS rule.

## Future Scope:
I will add new CSS rules if the necessity arrives.
